     Here I learned what is cybersecurity, its importance in the world and industries. It has a vast range of domains and roles from developing tools for security, analysing if proper security measures are 
     implemented , educating others about it, ethical hacking to test the security of the system and make it stronger, preventing and mitgating attacks etc. Also this course taught me about various methods of 
     attacks, the 8 CISSP domains, ethics in cybersecurity and the various tools used in this field.
