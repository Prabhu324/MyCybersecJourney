# My Google certificates:

All the below certificates are part of the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Security](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate) which will help me learn the skills for a role/job in cybersecurity. Currently I am in progress of completing the course which I am determined to complete by this year.
The links for all my activities are at the end of the page, whose details i have mentioned.

## 1. [Foundations](https://coursera.org/share/6104139b5fcd960c27bc08a531f3ec6a):

     Here I learned what is cybersecurity, its importance in the world and industries. It has a vast range of domains and roles from developing tools for security, analysing if proper security measures are 
     implemented , educating others about it, ethical hacking to test the security of the system and make it stronger, preventing and mitgating attacks etc. Also this course taught me about various methods of 
     attacks, the 8 CISSP domains,the CIA triad, ethics in cybersecurity and the various tools used in this field.
     
## 2. [Managing Risks](https://coursera.org/share/18efaf0c33a4dc00688ac7fc9670053c)

     This course taught me about risk management skills and details of the CISSP domains, NIST CISF and the CIA triad. From preventing risks by using techniques like strong passwords, proper access rules, use of 
     firewalls, antivirus, monitoring the network logs using  SIEM to intercept any suscpicious activity in the network, following the NIST CISF to create a secure framework and controls. Also the use of playbooks 
     which should be followed by an analyst in any case of attack that happens to the system of the organisation. I was tasked to write a security audit as well for a company by analysing the controls and 
     compliance checklist. 
## 3. [Network and Network Security](https://coursera.org/share/dcfcd4b839cd64f5bf2d93c41b5e15c8)
